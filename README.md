## What is it? 

Springboard is a public website that lists open-source projects collected by creators through pull-requests.

## Why should I contribute?

Finding users who will use your code isn't easy at all. It is even more difficult to find someone to contribute to your project. 
Placing your project on the `projects.list` will help you get a little more visibility.

## Get Started

1. Add your own project to [projects.list](https://github.com/javanile/springboard/edit/main/projects.list)
1. Send us a pull request!

**If you think of multiple projects, please submit them as separate PRs**, it is recommended to have separate statistics.

Some other suggestions:

* Be meaningful. Add projects that are even only slightly useful for carrying out a specific task.
* Be funny. This is very subjective, we realize, so try not to take it personally if we don't get it.
* Use actual words. Let people easily understand what they can do with your project.
* Avoid developer profile pages, people are not products.
* Avoid pojects that are gendered, sexual, religious, aggressive, or violent. We are a diverse, positive place.
* Avoid using proper country and/or corporate names (except it refer to a tecnology).
